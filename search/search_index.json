Applications range from soil moisture to streamflow to water quality and ecosystem. Through this portal, we collect all of our published models so you can navigate through them easily. These codes are developed by the Multiscale Hydrology, Processes and Intelligence (MHPI) group headed by Dr. Chaopeng Shen, faculty member at Penn State Univ (http://water.engr.psu.edu/shen). Codes are contributed by the whole MHPI team (https://sites.google.com/view/mhpi/team).</p> <p>The two model classes each have their own advantages. Purely data-driven models are great because they are: (i) easy to train and run at scale. (ii) automatically adaptable to predictable errors in forcings (iii) highly efficient in computation. (iv) not heavily prone to human bias in model selection.  </p> <p>Differentiable models mix process-based equations (called priors) and neural networks (NNs) at the fundamental level so they can be trained together in one stage (called \"end-to-end\"). This way, the network components can be supervised indirectly by outputs of the combined system, and do not necessarily need supervising data for its direct outputs. Differentiability can be supported by automatic differentiation, adjoint (Song et al., 2023, https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2023-258/), or any other method that can produce the gradients of loss with respect to large amounts of parameters efficiently. Such models can train one neural network using big data, improving the generalizability, robustness, and complexity of the learned relationships.   </p> <p>While being able to match purely data-driven models in performance in even data-dense regions, differentiable models have the following advantages: (1) Interpretable: they represent the full physical processes and output intermediate physical variables not used in training, e.g., ET, recharge, snow water equivalent, which help to provide an explainable narrative. (2) Generalizability: because of the use of priors, differentiable models often generalize better under data-sparse regions like in global hydrologic simulations. (Feng et al., 2023a, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2357-2023; 2023b, https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2023-190/) (3) (Under investigation) Extremes: forced by physical priors, the differentiable models may be better at representing unseen extreme scenarios and future trends. (4) Knowledge Discovery: we can use NNs as question marks in the combined system to learn unknown/uncertain relationships from data. In this sense, the priors serve to constrain or narrow down the scope of learning so we can understand the learned relationships. (5) Respect physical laws and sensitivities: we can force the model to respect laws such as mass balance, energy-driven evapotranspiration, etc. so our model has the correct sensitivities.</p>"},{"location":"Contribute/","title":"Contribute","text":""},{"location":"Contribute/#tbd","title":"TBD","text":""},{"location":"Example/","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Several examples related to the above papers are presented here.

The main difference between the differentiable model and many other previous physics-guided frameworks is that the process-based model is written in a differentiable platform like those used for NNs. This approach makes it possible for the framework to seamlessly integrate both machine learning and process-based model parts and be trained as a unified model (Shen et al., 2023). The training process is \u201cend-to-end,\u201d with any parameters within the model being learnable by gradient descent, just like when a pure LSTM model is trained. Thus, there is no need to calibrate each component independently. In other words, the process-based model becomes a part of the NN with the added advantage of process transparency.. All the hybrid models were trained on daily water temperature observations for 415 stations across the conterminous United States (CONUS).

A well-calibrated model can reasonably propagate information from observations to unobserved variables via model physics, but traditional calibration is highly inefficient  and results in non-unique solutions. Here we propose a novel differentiable parameter learning (dPL) framework that efficiently learns a global mapping between inputs  (and optionally responses) and parameters. Crucially, dPL exhibits beneficial scaling curves not previously demonstrated to geoscientists: as training data increases,  dPL achieves better performance, more physical coherence, and better generalizability (across space and uncalibrated variables), all with orders-of-magnitude lower  computational cost. We demonstrate examples that learned from soil moisture and streamflow, where dPL drastically outperformed existing evolutionary and regionalization methods, or required only ~12.5% of the training data to achieve similar performance.

However, hydrologic routing simulations, necessary for simulating floods in stem rivers downstream of large heterogeneous basins, had not yet benefited from these advances and it was unclear if the routing process could be improved via coupled NNs. We present a novel differentiable routing method (\u03b4MC-Juniata-hydroDL2) that mimics the classical Muskingum-Cunge routing model over a river network but embeds an NN to infer parameterizations for Manning's roughness (n) and channel geometries from raw reach-scale attributes like catchment areas and sinuosity. The NN was trained solely on downstream hydrographs. Synthetic experiments show that while the channel geometry parameter was unidentifiable, n can be identified with moderate precision. With real-world data, the trained differentiable routing model produced more accurate long-term routing results for both the training gage and untrained inner gages for larger subbasins (&gt;2,000\u00a0km2) than either a machine learning model assuming homogeneity, or simply using the sum of runoff from subbasins. The n parameterization trained on short periods gave high performance in other periods, despite significant errors in runoff inputs. The learned n pattern was consistent with literature expectations, demonstrating the framework's potential for knowledge discovery, but the absolute values can vary depending on training periods. The trained n parameterization can be coupled with traditional models to improve national-scale hydrologic flood simulations.},\nyear = {2024}\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"codes/feng_2023/","title":"\\(\\delta\\) HBV-hydroDL","text":""},{"location":"codes/feng_2023/#code-release","title":"Code Release","text":"<p>The codes for differentiable hydrologic models are released at this zenodo link</p>"},{"location":"codes/feng_2023/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Differentiable hydrologic modeling provides a generic approach to unify machine learning and physical models.

These so-called differentiable hydrologic models can achieve state-of-the-art hydrologic simulation accuracy tested in public benchmark dataset while also keep physical process clarity. Different from the purely machine learning methods, differentiable models can provide accurate simulations for a full set of untrained hydrologic variables. We further compared the extrapolation ability of different models (prediction in ungauged regions) in both continental and global scales. Differentiable models stand out showing superior spatial generalization performance compared with traditional parameter regionalization and purely machine learning methods (Feng et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023).

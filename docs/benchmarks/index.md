# Benchmarks

We here provide comparisons to LSTM models on the CAMELS data (top of page) as well as comparisons to the current National Water Model at the national scale (bottom of this page), and more comparisons will be provided here.

We recently updated our LSTM, and you can find the high-flow expert on hydroDL repo's tutorial (see Codes tab on this website). The first and forecast benchmark is over the CAMELS dataset. The results can vary slightly due to training/test periods. Below you will find results for 10-year training (exactly as reported in Kratzert et al., 2019) and 15-year training (shown in this Figure). Besides NSE and KGE, we also report absolute FHV and FLV (these metrics have + or - signs, and they make more sense after taking the absolute sign) and low-flow and high-flow RMSE. So far, the best LSTM is LSTM-hydroDL (high-flow expert) and the best differentiable model is $\delta$HBV.adjoint (https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2023-258/). As time goes on, we will also report benchmarks on the global dataset and other papers. We also know that spatial test (trained on some basins, tested on some other basins) or prediction in ungauged regions (PUR) tests (tested in a large region without training data) are more stringent tests and will likely change the comparisons. We previously found differentiable model to perform better in the PUR test (Feng et al., 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2357-2023).

We compared 3 versions of differentiable HBV model ("Unmodified"-- without any structural update; $\delta$HBV -- a sequential differentiable HBV published in Feng et al., 2022; and $\delta$HBV.adjoint, slightly modified from Song et al., 2023. See refs below) with two versions of hydroDL implementation (a high-flow expert and a low-flow expert). We also trained the LSTM from Kratzert 2019 for comparison.  </figcaption>

## Comparison with National Water Models
Funded by CIROH projects, we have produced initial comparisons at the continental scale showing the superior performance of the differentiable models compared to both NOAA’s first-generation WRF-Hydro.NWM Model, version 1.2 (Tijerina‐Kreuzer et al., 2021) and version 2.1 (Cosgrove et al., 2024). The differentiable routing model developed in our FY22 CIROH project is used for runoff routing using Muskingum-Cunge method. We are now producing seamless streamflow simulations at high spatial resolution for the whole CONUS and the results below are demonstrating one of the simulations. We are still improving the runoff, forcing, and routing aspects of the product. Several updates are incoming. Please stand by for a data release!

## Ensemble performances
Significant benefits were achieved by ensembling **δHBV** and **LSTM** models across temporal, **PUB** (Prediction in Ungauged Basin), and **PUR** (Prediction in Ungauged region) tests. All models were trained from **October 1, 1980** to **September 30, 1995** on all **671 CAMELS** basins, and tested from **October 1, 1995** to **September 30, 2008** on a selected set of **531 basins**.

<figcaption>

Median NSE values for 531 CAMELS basins, indicating model and ensemble performances for (a) temporal, (b) prediction in ungauged basin (PUB), and (c) prediction in ungauged region (PUR) tests. Different simulations are represented by variously-shaped and -colored points, and are organized by ensemble group, listed along the x-axis: LSTM, δHBV, LSTM+δHBV, and their “ensemble forcing” counterparts, LSTM<sup>ef</sup>, δHBV<sup>ef</sup>, and LSTM+δHBV<sup>ef</sup>. LSTM<sup>multi</sup> is a single LSTM model trained directly on all three forcing datasets at once. The superscript “ef” denotes the forcing datasets involved in each ensemble (choices of 1 for Daymet, 2 for NLDAS, and 3 for Maurer), while the “+” connects the model types used within an ensemble. The x-axis group and subscript “seed” indicate that simulation results were averaged based on three different random seeds (see Figure C1). Other points without “seed”, along with their corresponding error bars, are derived from the averages of metrics computed over repeated runs with three different random seeds. The error bar indicates one standard deviation above and below the average value for each simulation.
